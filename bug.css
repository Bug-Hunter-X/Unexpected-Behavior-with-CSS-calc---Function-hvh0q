The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because `10` lacks a unit.  Another issue arises when nesting `calc()`.  Incorrectly nested calculations can lead to parsing errors or unexpected values.  Also, older browsers might have limited or inconsistent support for complex `calc()` expressions.
